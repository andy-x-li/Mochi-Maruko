# Mochi-Maruko-Scripts

Some of the scripts I've coded for my original video game. 

Since I do most of the programming in the game, many of the scripts lack comments and function documentation. 

However, `Character.cs` (which is an old version of my main character script) is very well documented. 

All files are coded in C# by me and some are inspired by tutorials online. 

All scripts are from my game's Unity project, where I use visual scripting to attach these scripts to components and set their script variables.
