# Mochi-Maruko-Scripts

Some of the scripts I've coded for my original video game. 

Since I do almost all the programming in the game, many of the scripts lack comments and function documentation. 

However, Character.cs (which is an old version of my main character script) is very well documented. 

All files are coded in C# by me and some are inspired by tutorials online. 

All scripts are from my game's Unity project, where I then do a lot of visual scripting to attach these scripts to components and attach components to script variables.
